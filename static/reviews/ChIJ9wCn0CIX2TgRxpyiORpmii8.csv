The staff of procedure room is very hard working and they take care of sterilisation during the procedure. The best thing, Dr Habib is available there and he explained the procedure in easy way. Next day, Dr Habib and his staff explained the post procedure care and gave me chance to ask my doubts. I recommend Dr Habib clinic for hair transplant. I also suggest to take money with you for discharge medicine as I did not carry money with me.;5;06/28/2024 13:01:02

From the initial consultation to the procedure the entire staff was professional, kind, and attentive.

Dr Habib  and his team were meticulous and skilled throughout the procedure. They took the time to answer all my questions and made sure I was comfortable throughout.

The clinic's facilities were modern, clean, and well-equipped. The staff's expertise and dedication to their craft are evident in every aspect of the process.

It's only been a day since the transplant, but I'm already feeling confident and excited about my new hair growth journey. I highly recommend Dr Habib hair transplant and cosmetic surgery clinic to anyone considering a hair transplant. Five stars isn't enough - I'd give them ten stars if I could!""

Thank you So much Dr Habib and His entire staff.";5;07/06/2024 06:54:09
