The staff is not even a bit trained. A nurse did not even know how to inject branula she injected and took it out atleast 10 times in my hand until my hand became blue and swelled. When I said to her she blamed me. Not recommended not even for an injection. Picture attached is taken after 7 hours hand is still blue and swelling can be seen.;1;07/16/2024 21:14:31

Hospital administration need to correct the prices.
We know that hospitals are very profitable and safe investment in Pakistan and flourishing with the help of corrupt system. However , People are advised not to use them untill hospital administration take the corrective action. Looking forward to see a positive response by the hospital.";2;05/01/2024 16:04:25
